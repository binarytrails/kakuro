\section{Iteration 1}

{\bf Date:} 9 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 20.15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 20.30 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian, Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} Hall Building 920 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- Meet and know about teamates\\ - Select communication and code sharing platforms \\
{\bf Outcomes:} \\
- Everyone shared their phone numbers and email. \\
- We decided to use discord for communication, Trello for project organization and github for code management.
\\
\\
{\bf Date:} 15 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19.15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21.00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian, Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} Hall Building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- Learn more about the project, rules and requirements.\\
- We wrote all our ideas and user cases that we could come up on a google docs.\\
- Assign roles.\\ 
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
-Everyone got a specific user case scenario to research on. I took the role of coder and  the 'submit game' scenario to work on. \\
- Organizers took the responsibility to set up discord, Trello and Github.\\


{\bf Date:} 16 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 20.15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 20.30 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian, Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} Hall Building 920 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- Confirmed everyone's role.\\ 
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
- Decided to have a coders meeting.
\\
\\
\\
{\bf Date:} 17 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 10.30 \\
{\bf End Time:} 13.00 \\
{\bf Who:}\\ Isabelle Charette, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nalveer Moocheet, Audrey-Laure St-Louis. \\
{\bf Where:} LB-353(kenya) group study room \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- We started thinking of the programming behind the user cases. We worked on prototype domain models and UML diagrams to represent our ideas as coders and shared them to the rest of the team.\\
-Each coder selected the part they want to work on. I decided to code the 'submit' user case.\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
- We provided a better foundation for the documenters to start working on and all coders had a clear idea of how we would proceed with the coding part.\\


{\bf Date:} 22 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 19.15 \\
{\bf End Time:} 21.00 \\
{\bf Who:} Tiffany Ah King, Isabelle Charette, Brian, Gamboc-Javiniar, Vsevolod Ivanov, Chang Liu, Nolan Mckay, Nalveer Moocheet, Hoang Thuan Pham, Audrey-Laure St-Louis, Jia Ming Wei \\
{\bf Where:} Hall Building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- Got more information and explanation for user cases and project requirements.\\
- Went through the list of our user cases and modified a few of them based on the tutorial explanations.\\
- We all provided an update of our individual works\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
- Decided to have a coders meeting the following week to start merging our codes.\\
- I later during that week completed the function 'solveBoard' which loops through the game board and returns true if all the sums are correct.\\

{\bf Date:} 29 January 2020 \\
{\bf Start Time:} 17.00 \\
{\bf End Time:} 19.00 \\
{\bf Who:} Isabelle Charette, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nalveer Moocheet, Audrey-Laure St-Louis \\
{\bf Where:} Grey Nuns B-122 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- Merged all codes and tested the program before the demo.\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
- The program worked perfectly and was ready for the demo\\
- Identified few changes we need to make before iteration 1 submission.\\
\\

{\bf Where:} Hall Building 831 \\
{\bf Activities:}\\
- Made a presentation of our work during the demo\\
{\bf Outcomes:}\\
- We got feedback on both the documentation and code\\
- Everyone got a clear idea of what they need to do before the final submission.\\
- Wrote the test codes using JUnit for the function 'solveBoard' before the next lab.
